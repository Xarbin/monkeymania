MonkeyMania CSV Fix Prompt Template
Copy and paste this prompt when you need to fix a CSV file for Mon Kee:

Prompt:
I need you to help me fix a CSV file for my MonkeyMania trading system. The CSV has missing price data that prevents Mon Kee from executing trades.
Here's what I need:

Fill missing Pre-market Close prices using this priority:

If "Price" column has a valid value (>0), use that
If no Price but "Gap % 1 day" exists, calculate: Price = 5.0 * (1 + Gap% / 100)
If volume is very high (>10M) but no price, estimate at $3.00
If volume is moderate (1M-10M), estimate at $5.00
Otherwise, mark as $1.00 with a note


Add a new column called "Mon_Kee_Price" that contains:

The best available price from above logic
Never blank or NaN
Always positive numbers


Add a "Price_Source" column that indicates:

"premarket" if from Pre-market Close
"regular" if from Price column
"gap_estimate" if calculated from gap
"volume_estimate" if estimated from volume
"default" if using $1.00 fallback


Clean up data:

Ensure all tickers are uppercase
Remove any rows where Symbol is blank
Round all prices to 2 decimal places
Ensure percentage values are numbers (not strings with % symbol)


Sort the data by:

First by Gap % 1 day (descending)
Then by Volume 1 day (descending)



Example of what the output should look like:
Symbol | Description | Pre-market Close | Price | Mon_Kee_Price | Price_Source | Gap % 1 day | Volume 1 day
AAPL   | Apple Inc.  | 150.25          | 150.30| 150.25        | premarket    | 2.5         | 50000000
TSLA   | Tesla Inc.  | NaN             | 250.00| 250.00        | regular      | 5.0         | 30000000
MEME   | Meme Stock  | NaN             | NaN   | 5.50          | gap_estimate | 10.0        | 20000000
Please process the CSV and ensure Mon Kee can trade every stock by having valid prices for all rows.

Additional Context to Include:
When you upload your CSV, also mention:

The date of the data (if known)
Whether it's pre-market or post-market data
Any specific stocks you want to ensure have accurate prices
Your preferred default price for unknown stocks (if different from $1.00)

Example Usage:
"Here's my movers_pre6_4.csv file from June 4th pre-market data. Please fix it according to the MonkeyMania CSV format requirements above. For any biotech stocks (check description), use $2.00 as the default instead of $1.00."
